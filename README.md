- `cd philo`
- `make all`
- `./philo [n] [limit] [eat duration] [sleep duration] [eat reps(optional)]`
  - n: number of philosophers
  - limit: The amount of time one can endure without eating
  - eat duration: The amount of time spent on eating
  - sleep duration: The amount of time spent on sleeping
  - eat reps: Number of meals; the simulation ends when all philosophers have eaten at least this many times
